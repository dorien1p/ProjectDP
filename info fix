Your log is failing **before it even builds omxiv** because your system can’t find RetroPie’s required packages:

* `libraspberrypi-dev`
* `libraspberrypi-doc`

On **Debian 13 (trixie) arm64** those packages are **not in the default Debian repos**, so `apt` says *“no installation candidate”*.

### The bigger issue (important)

Even if you fix the repo, **omxiv is deprecated and (per the project) OpenMAX libraries aren’t available for arm64**, meaning it’s generally **not expected to work on your 64-bit setup**. ([GitHub][1])

So you have two realistic paths:

---

## Option 1 (Recommended): Don’t use omxiv on arm64 — use an alternative viewer

If your goal is “show images on RetroPie / Pi”:

**Console / framebuffer style:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fim
```

**If you have X/desktop available:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install feh
```

---

## Option 2: Make RetroPie able to install `libraspberrypi-dev` (repo fix)

This addresses the *exact error you posted*, because those packages come from the Raspberry Pi archive repo (which has a trixie suite). ([archive.raspberrypi.org][2])

1. Add the Raspberry Pi archive keyring + repo:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install raspberrypi-archive-keyring

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/raspberrypi-archive-keyring.pgp] http://archive.raspberrypi.com/debian/ trixie main" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspberrypi-archive.list

sudo apt update
```

(That `signed-by` path is the one people use on trixie.) ([Raspberry Pi Forums][3])

2. Try installing the missing deps:

```bash
sudo apt install libraspberrypi-dev libraspberrypi-doc libpng-dev libjpeg-dev
```

### But expect this next

Even after that, **omxiv will likely still fail on arm64** (or be unusable) because of the OpenMAX/arm64 limitation noted by the omxiv maintainer. ([GitHub][1])
If you *must* use omxiv specifically, the practical solution is a **32-bit (armhf) RetroPie / Raspberry Pi OS** install.

If you want, paste the next build output after you run Option 2 (the first compile error you hit), and I’ll tell you immediately whether it’s fixable on your current 64-bit install or if it’s hitting the OpenMAX wall.
