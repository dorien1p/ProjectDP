That log confirms the same root problem: on your **Pi 4 + 64-bit OS (aarch64) + Debian 13 (trixie)**, RetroPie’s `omxiv` install script is trying to pull **legacy Raspberry Pi userland dev packages** that **don’t exist for your system**:

* `libraspberrypi-dev`
* `libraspberrypi-doc`

So the install **cannot proceed** (it dies at dependency install). The “replacement” it suggests (`libdtovl0:armhf`) is a hint that the stuff it wants lives in the **32-bit (armhf)** world, not your 64-bit one.

### What you can do (pick one)

## 1) Best on 64-bit: stop trying to install omxiv and use a working viewer

You already installed them:

### Console / RetroPie environment (no desktop)

```bash
fim /path/to/image.png
fim -a /path/to/folder
```

### Desktop / X11

```bash
feh /path/to/image.png
feh -F /path/to/folder
```

This is the clean solution on 64-bit.

## 2) If you *must* use omxiv: you need 32-bit (armhf)

Realistically:

* install **32-bit RetroPie / Raspberry Pi OS**, **or**
* run a **32-bit userspace** (advanced + annoying; not worth it for an image viewer)

Because `omxiv` is tied to old OpenMAX + `libraspberrypi` userland, which isn’t supported the way this script expects on modern 64-bit setups.

---

## 3) If you just want RetroPie-Setup to stop erroring on dependencies

You can also **disable / avoid installing omxiv** and use your alternative viewer.

---

### Quick cleanup (you had this earlier)

If you still see “configured multiple times” warnings during `apt update`, run:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspberrypi-archive.list
sudo apt update
```

---

If you tell me *where* you want to view images from (inside EmulationStation? from a shell script? as a screensaver?), I’ll give you the exact command + a simple launcher script using **fim** (console) or **feh** (desktop) that fits your RetroPie workflow.
