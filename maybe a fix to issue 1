Got it — on Raspberry Pi 64-bit OS (aarch64), omxiv is basically a no-go in practice, because it relies on the old OpenMAX / libraspberrypi userland that RetroPie’s script expects, and those packages aren’t provided for your setup (that’s exactly why libraspberrypi-dev has “no installation candidate”). So the right move is: use a different viewer (you already installed two good ones), or switch to 32-bit if you truly need omxiv.

Here’s what to do on 64-bit:

1) Remove the duplicate repo entry (fix warnings)

You already have the Pi repo via raspi.sources, so delete the extra file you added:

sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspberrypi-archive.list
sudo apt update

2) Use a working image viewer on 64-bit
If you’re in RetroPie / console (no desktop)

Use fim (framebuffer):

fim /path/to/image.png


Browse a folder:

fim -a /path/to/folder

If you have a desktop / X11 running

Use feh:

feh /path/to/image.png


Fullscreen browse:

feh -F /path/to/folder

3) If you still want to build stuff from source

You’re missing CMake:

sudo apt install -y cmake build-essential git pkg-config

4) If you must have omxiv specifically

Your reliable option is:

Switch to a 32-bit RetroPie / Raspberry Pi OS (armhf)

Because on 64-bit, the required legacy stack isn’t there in the form RetroPie expects.

If you tell me which situation you’re in:

A) you want to view images in terminal / EmulationStation environment, or

B) you want to view images in a desktop,

I’ll give you the clean “best” command setup (and a tiny script) so you can launch it easily from RetroPie.
